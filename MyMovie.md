## Jackson Ozanne

My favorite movie is *Ready Player One*. My favorite part of the movie is all of the pop culture references. 
Pieces of my childhood are littered throughout the movie like *Star Wars*, *The Iron Giant*, *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*, and one of my favorite songs of all time *Jump* by Van Halen. I also enjoy the movies humor which keeps the action sequences in check without making the film seem childish. Plus who can complain about a story where a bunch of friends band together to defeat an evil corporation polluting the world's main source of happiness

The main characters in the movie are played by Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke

### Substitute Actors
| Actor | Reason | Age |
|---|---|---: |
| Cameron Boyce | Boyce was an electric young actor who was known for playing video game loving characters and I feel he would have excelled in this role | 25 |
| Tom Holland | In a movie full of easter eggs having the most recent Spiderman as your lead would have been a great success | 28 |
| Will Poulter | Poulter's expierence with action roles in *Guardians of the Galaxy 3* and *The Maze Runner* would have made him well prepared for the sci-fi combat scenes in this movie | 32 |
| Jesse Eisenberg | Wade Watts is a quirky character and Eisenberg has shown he can display that type of character perfectly in the *Zombieland* franchise | 41 |

This code snippet demonstrates how to do logging in Python. 
```
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s:%(name)s:%(message)s')

file_handler = logging.FileHandler('sample.log')
file_handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
stream_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

logger.addHandler(file_handler)
logger.addHandler(stream_handler) 
```
