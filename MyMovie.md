##Jackson Ozanne

My favorite movie is *Ready Player One*. My favorite part of the movie is all of the pop culture references. 
Pieces of my childhood are littered throughout the movie like *Star Wars*, *The Iron Giant*, *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*, and one of my favorite songs of all time *Jump* by Van Halen. I also enjoy the movies humor which keeps the action sequences in check without making the film seem childish. Plus who can complain about a story where a bunch of friends band together to defeat an evil corporation polluting the world's main source of happiness

The main characters in the movie are played by Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke
